Simple brightness tray app - must be run with sudo

requires both XRANDR and DDCUTIL installed

scrolling on the tray icon changes XRANDR brightness from 100 - 0
clicking on the icon brings up 3 options for changing the monitors brightness through DDCUTIL - sadly performance is too slow to only rely on DDCUTIL

TODO - implement Control
